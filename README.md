# Health-Chatbot
This project provides a multilingual AI chatbot that can be accessed via WhatsApp or SMS to provide information on preventive healthcare, disease symptoms, vaccination schedules, and simulated outbreak alerts.  This version is integrated with Twilio, allowing it to communicate via messaging apps instead of a web interface.
